Hi! Welcome to my personal site. 

I am currently Undergraduate Statistics in the [Departament of Statistics](https://www.des.uem.br), at the [State University of Maringá](https://www.uem.br) and Junior Data Analyst at [VG Educacional](https://www.vgeducacional.com). This website contains some information
[about myself](/about) and things I learn, mostly in R, Python, SAS and Web Development.
